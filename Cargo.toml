# Minimum required rust version:

# NOTE: See README.md for implications on how feature selection will affect build-time. As of this writing, binary
# builds of skia are available for ALL of the features or NONE of the features. Only selecting some of the features will
# require building skia from scratch, which will greatly increase build times

# svg and shaper are deprecated. svg is always available, and shaper is included with textlayout. However, leaving them
# since skia_safe prints informative error messages.
