# Minimum required rust version:
# rust="1.37"

# NOTE: See README.md for implications on how feature selection will affect build-time. As of this writing, binary
# builds of skia are available for ALL of the features or NONE of the features. Only selecting some of the features will
# require building skia from scratch, which will greatly increase build times
